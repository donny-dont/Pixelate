# Pixelate

A UI widget library for creating modern web applications; Pixelate targets the modern web by using Web Components. The library leverages the [Dart Web UI library](https://github.com/dart-lang/web-ui) to create a set of widgets that would be expected in native native application development.

Pixelate was built for game developers wishing to migrate their tools to the web, but that doesn't preclude other developers from using the provided widgets.

# Components

Pixelate implements very low level widgets, such as buttons and accordions, but also more complex controls, such as a file uploader. To see what components are available visit the [demo page](http://) which showcases all the components in action.

# Themes

Pixelate was built with customization in mind. All components have hooks, either through psuedo classes or CSS variables, to change the styling to fit the application. The themes provided are modern flat designs.

# Disclaimer

Pixelate is meant for desktop replacement applications, and uses bleeding edge web technologies. Because of this backwards compatibility to older browsers is not a priority.

Pixelate has been tested on the following browsers

* Chrome 27+
