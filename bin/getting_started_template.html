    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Pixelate is provided as a <a class="external" href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/pixelate">pub package</a> for easy installation. Modify the pubspec.yaml file to include references to Pixelate and the default theme as follows.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre class="code">
        <code>{{pubspec}}</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <p>If you use Dart Editor, select your project from the Files view, then goto Tools, and run Pub Install.</p>
    <p>If you use the command line, ensure the Dart SDK is on your path, and then run: pub install</p>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To start using a Pixelate component it needs to be referenced and added to the site's HTML. All components can be found within the packages/pixelate/components path. These can be added through the import tag within the HTML document as follows.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <pre class="code">
        <code>{{example}}</code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h2>Themes</h2>
    <p>Pixelate elements do not come with their own built in look and feel. Instead the elements can be styled externally through a theme. Theme's are provided as additional pub packages so its simple for a user to swap for a theme that fits the designer's whims.</p>
    <p>The Pixelate author's provide the <a class="external" href="http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/pixelate">Pixelate Flat Theme</a>, which is a modern, darkly colored, flat design. It is inspired by <a class="external" href="http://designmodo.com/square/">Square UI</a> from <a class="external" href="http://designmodo.com">Designmodo</a>.</p>
